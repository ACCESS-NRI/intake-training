# A collection of training material on Intake

All notebooks assume that you are working on Gadi in an environment with at least the Python package `access-nri-intake` installed (e.g. the [hh5 public conda environment](http://climate-cms.wikis.unsw.edu.au/Conda)). Users must also be members of the `xp65` project to access the catalog. Additional project membership requirements are given at the start of each notebook.
